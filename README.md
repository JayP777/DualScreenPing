# DualScreenPing 

# About

This is just a simple ping app that allows people with dual screens to view their current ping. The specified target group for this app  would be gamers. The app starts to ping once it detects that there is another app running in full-screen. The idea was to keep it sweet  and simple; the app is opened and set on the secondary monitor of the computer and once the user opens an application that runs in full- screen the app will start to ping the local google address.


# Stuff ToDo:

1) Currently the ping app only pings 8.8.8.8 which is the local IP of Google in my area. So maybe there's a way to enable the app to          capture the area of the users' PC and change the ping accordingly?
2) Interface customization? Currently the app is set to change the color of the digits to red and blue when pings go above a certain          threshold. There's also a visual display that switches between Green, Orange and Red according to the average ping, indicating wether      it is adviced to play online or rather not.
3) Resolve any bugs or errors that may occur that were overseen.

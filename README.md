# DualScreenPing
# This is just a simple ping app that allows people with dual screens to view their current ping. The specified target group for this app # would be gamers. The app starts to ping once it detects that there is another app running in full-screen. The idea was to keep it sweet # and simple; the app is opened and set on the secondary monitor of the computer and once the user opens an application that runs in full-# screen the app will start to ping the local google address.
